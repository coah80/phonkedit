2. Download [Fabric API](https://modrinth.com/mod/fabric-api) and place it in your `mods` folder
3. Download the latest **Phonk Edit** release from [here](https://github.com/coah80/phonkedit/releases)
4. Place the `phonkedit-*.jar` file in your `.minecraft/mods` folder
5. Launch Minecraft with the Fabric profile

## Configuration

You can configure Phonk Edit in two ways:

### In-Game (Recommended)

2. Click "Mods" button in main menu
3. Find "Phonk Edit" and click the config button

```json

  "effectDuration": 3000,
  "shakeIntensity": 1.0
}
```

- `enablePhonkEffect` - Enable/disable the mod (default: `true`)

## Building from Source

### Prerequisites

- **Java Development Kit (JDK) 21** (recommended; 17+ supported)
- **Git**
 - You do not need Gradle installed (the Gradle wrapper is included)

### Windows

```powershell
git clone https://github.com/coah80/phonkedit.git
cd phonkedit
.\gradlew.bat build
```

### Linux/macOS

```bash
git clone https://github.com/coah80/phonkedit.git
cd phonkedit
./gradlew build
```

The compiled JAR will be in `build/libs/`

### Development

To run the mod in a development environment:

```powershell
# Windows
.\gradlew.bat runClient

# Linux/macOS
./gradlew runClient
```

Tips
- If the build can‚Äôt find Java on Windows, install a 64‚Äëbit JDK 21 and ensure `java -version` works in PowerShell
- If you have multiple JDKs, set `JAVA_HOME` before running Gradle
- In VS Code, you can also use the ‚ÄúRun Minecraft Client‚Äù task if it‚Äôs available

## Troubleshooting

### Mod doesn't load
- Verify you have Fabric Loader and Fabric API installed
- Check that you're using Minecraft 1.21.1
- Ensure Java 21 (or at least 17) is installed

### No sound from custom songs
- Enable the generated resource pack at `.minecraft/resourcepacks/phonkedit-custom-songs/`
- Place `.ogg` files in `.minecraft/config/phonkedit/songs/` (simple lowercase filenames recommended)
- Use the Resource Packs menu ‚ÄúDone‚Äù button to reload after changes

### Can‚Äôt save while the effect is active
- The effect ends when you open the pause menu, specifically so saving and quitting always works

## Custom Songs (Optional)

Drop-in via config folder:

1) Put .ogg files in `.minecraft/config/phonkedit/songs/`
2) On first run, the mod exports the built-in tracks there so you can delete/replace them
3) The mod generates a resource pack at `.minecraft/resourcepacks/phonkedit-custom-songs/`
4) Enable ‚ÄúPhonk Edit - Custom Songs‚Äù in the Resource Packs menu (one time)
5) After that, changes in the songs folder are picked up on reload

Notes
- Use simple lowercase filenames (letters, numbers, underscores). We sanitize names automatically.
- Tracks are streamed and included in the same random selection as built-ins.
- Please trim your tracks to the beat drop, itll work best then.
- Custom songs are capped at 5 seconds, to minimize the jank

## Custom Images (Optional aswell)

Drop-in via config folder:

1) Put images in `.minecraft/config/phonkedit/images/`
  - Supported: PNG, JPG/JPEG, GIF (including animated), BMP, WBMP, TIF/TIFF
2) On first run, the mod exports the built-in skulls there so you can delete/replace them
3) Images are auto-resized to 256√ó256
5) Restart Minecraft to reload images (they load at game start)

Tips
- For best results, start from 256√ó256 PNGs with transparent background
- Animated GIFs will play; total duration depends on the frame delays inside the GIF
